# slackinviter

This is a [slackin](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin) clone written in Go because... Nodejs bloat and Go is much nicer :-)

I will add a vendor tool of choice later, until then just grab dependencies and `go build` it. Run binary with -h for help, it just takes recaptcha secret + sitekey + slack api token as parameter, and listenAddr.
